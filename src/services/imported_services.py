Stub for imported services from monorepo.

These services were used for tracking file upload status and ingestion status
in the full genai-idp monorepo. They are stubbed out here for the standalone extractor.

If you need these features, you can either:
1. Implement lightweight versions
2. Copy the relevant libraries from the monorepo
3. Use a different status tracking mechanism
